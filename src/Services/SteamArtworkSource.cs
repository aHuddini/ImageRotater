    // Worth having as the FIRST source because of what Steam serves: plain
    // JPEG and PNG, which WPF decodes natively. SteamGridDB's animated results

    // neither, so those need ffmpeg before they can even be shown moving.

    // SteamGridDB has dozens. So this is the reliable default rather than the
    // interesting one.

    // still on the CDN - verified across several games - and are plain MP4
    // that MediaElement plays with no ffmpeg and no yt-dlp involved.
